In this project, I have used the python software version 3.5

I took advantage of the Amazon udacity AMI, used Keras framework with tensorflow backend in order to train my model.

This project is from a kaggle competition... 
The competition name is: Statoil/C-CORE Iceberg Classifier Challenge.
Please, you can download the dataset from there, or I can provide it if requested.
